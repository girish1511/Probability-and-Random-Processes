------------------------------Image Restoration------------------------------

-Place the MATLAB file and the folder 'Test' and 'Train' in the same folder

-Run the file 'Img_Restor'

-The dataset used for this assignment is dataset of standard 512x512 grayscale images whose link is mentioned in the report under the reference section.

-The program takes 10 images from 'Train' folder for training and 5 images from 'Test' folder for testing.

-Both the training and testing code are in the same MATLAB in 2 different cells and can be run separately.

-The code also contains another cell which when run displays the results(psnr) in the form plots and also prints the results in the form table in the console.

-The vector 'r' contains the psnr values for restored images and the vector 'x' contains the psnr values of the corrupt images.
